## 📖 Extended Description

The **global wave of layoffs**, particularly in the technology and startup ecosystem, has become a key topic of analysis for economists, investors, and data enthusiasts.  
This project provides a structured approach to **understanding layoffs data** using SQL, highlighting not only the raw numbers but also **contextual insights** about industries, geographies, and company stages.

The workflow follows a logical progression:  

1. **Data Cleaning** → Preparing the raw dataset by handling duplicates, formatting dates, trimming company names, and addressing missing values.  
2. **Exploration** → Running basic queries to understand the scale of layoffs (e.g., largest single events, companies with complete workforce cuts).  
3. **Aggregation** → Summarizing layoffs by year, industry, location, country, and stage to uncover macro trends.  
4. **Advanced Analytics** → Using window functions, rolling totals, and ranking logic to uncover deeper insights such as top companies per year or cumulative monthly layoffs.  

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used not just for CRUD operations but also for **business intelligence and storytelling with data**.  
It is an excellent resource for:  

- **SQL learners** → Practice with real-world style queries (from beginner to advanced).  
- **Data analysts** → Explore patterns, build narratives, and prepare for visualization.  
- **Researchers / HR professionals** → Understand how workforce reductions vary by sector and geography.  

Ultimately, this project transforms a raw dataset into **meaningful insights** that could feed dashboards, reports, or even predictive models for future workforce planning.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Exploration** → Preview and explore the dataset with `SELECT *`.  
- **Data Cleaning** → Remove duplicates, standardize fields, and fix data types.  
- **Easier Queries** →  
  - Find maximum layoffs  
  - Identify companies with 100% layoffs  
  - Check percentages and funding details  
- **Aggregated Insights** →  
  - Top companies, locations, countries, and industries by layoffs  
  - Year-wise and stage-wise summaries  
- **Advanced Analysis** →  
  - Rolling totals of layoffs by month  
  - CTEs for cumulative layoffs  
  - Ranking companies with most layoffs per year (Top 3 each year)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is stored in a table called **`standralising`**, containing:

- `company`  
- `industry`  
- `total_laid_off`  
- `percentage_laid_off`  
- `location`  
- `country`  
- `date`  
- `stage`  
- `funds_raised`  

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Deduplication (SQL)

### 1) Create a staging table

```sql
CREATE TABLE `standralising` LIKE layoffs;
INSERT `standralising`
SELECT * FROM layoffs;
2) Inspect potential duplicates
sql
Copy code
SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off, `date`,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
         PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off, `date`
         ORDER BY company
       ) AS row_num
FROM standralising;
3) Remove duplicate rows
sql
Copy code
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

DELETE s
FROM standralising AS s
JOIN (
  SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off, `date`, percentage_laid_off, stage, country,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off, `date`
           ORDER BY company
         ) AS row_num
  FROM standralising
) AS r
  ON s.company = r.company
 AND s.industry = r.industry
 AND s.total_laid_off = r.total_laid_off
 AND s.`date` = r.`date`
WHERE r.row_num > 1;

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
4) Normalize text fields
sql
Copy code
UPDATE standralising
SET company = TRIM(company);
5) Convert date strings to DATE type
sql
Copy code
UPDATE standralising
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');
6) Identify missing values
sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM standralising
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
   OR funds_raised IS NULL
   OR industry IS NULL
   OR `date` IS NULL;
🛠️ SQL Queries Breakdown
🔹 Easier Queries
sql
Copy code
-- Maximum layoffs
SELECT MAX(total_laid_off) FROM standralising;

-- Companies with 100% layoffs
SELECT * FROM standralising WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1;
🔹 Aggregated Insights
sql
Copy code
-- Total layoffs by industry
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
FROM standralising
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC;

-- Total layoffs by country
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
FROM standralising
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC;
🔹 Advanced Queries
sql
Copy code
-- Rolling total of layoffs per month
WITH DATE_CTE AS 
(
  SELECT SUBSTRING(date,1,7) AS dates, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
  FROM standralising
  GROUP BY dates
  ORDER BY dates ASC
)
SELECT dates, SUM(total_laid_off) OVER (ORDER BY dates ASC) AS rolling_total_layoffs
FROM DATE_CTE
ORDER BY dates ASC;
